## Abstract: 
To meet the space limitation of optical elements, free-form surfaces or high-order aspherical lenses are adopted in mobile cameras to compress volume. However, the application of free-form surfaces also introduces the problem of image quality mutation. Existing model-based deconvolution methods are inefficient in dealing with the degradation that shows a wide range of spatial variants over regions. And the deep learning techniques in low-level and physics-based vision suffer from a lack of accurate data. To address this issue, we develop a degradation framework to estimate the spatially variant point spread functions (PSFs) of mobile cameras. When input extreme-quality digital images, the proposed framework generates degraded images sharing a common domain with real-world photographs. Supplied with the synthetic image pairs, we design a Field-Of-View shared kernel prediction network (FOV-KPN) to perform spatial-adaptive reconstruction on real degraded photos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves extreme-quality computational imaging and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we illustrate that our technique can be integrated into existing postprocessing systems, resulting in significantly improved visual quality.

Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
