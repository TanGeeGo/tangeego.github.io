I am going to be a Postdoctral Researcher in the [Samueli ECE](https://www.ee.ucla.edu) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/), closely working with Prof. [Aydogan Ozcan](https://research.seas.ucla.edu/ozcan/). 

I received my Ph.D. at Zhejiang University, where I co-advised by Prof. [Huajun Feng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0086127) and Prof. [Zhihai Xu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0089108#0). My work involves both applied optics and computer vision to realize better computational photography.
