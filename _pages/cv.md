description: Hi, I'm a self-motivated, enthusiastic researcher in optical engineering. My work lies at the intersection of optics, graphics, and computer vision. I led the project of computational optics and deployed the relevant technology into the flagships of Huawei (from Huawei P50). My research interests are optical simulation, end-to-end optimization, learning-based image processing, and the next generation of optical computing methodology.
